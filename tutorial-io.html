We are organizing a <tt>p4est</tt> summer school
sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.

<h2>Graphics output and mesh load and save</h2>
<p class="book">
This tutorial is about file (networked/hard disk) I/O.
The first topic is writing specially formatted text files in the
<a href="https://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf">VTK format</a>.
The second topic is about writing the current state of the mesh to disk,
and about reading it back in, with the same or a different number of MPI ranks.
To this end, we use the MPI I/O interface standard.

<dt>Skills acquired</dt><dd>
You will have written cell- and corner-based numerical data to graphics files
and looked at them in third-party visualization software.
We also cover saving and loading the <tt>p4est</tt> mesh in a parallel
partition-independent format, which is great for flexible checkpointing
and overall reproducibility.
</dd>
<dt>Next steps</dt><dd>
Extend your hello-world program by adding a nonlinear, smooth geometry
transformation that is passed to the VTK output routine.
Extend the VTK output routine to write one big MPI file in the binary appended
VTK format (instead of many VTU files and one PVTU file as we do currently).

<h3>VTK graphics output</h3>
<p class="book">
We are creating and manipulating meshes, which are complex objects embedded in
2- or 3-dimensional space, and want to look at them.
To this end, <tt>p4est</tt> provides the files <code>p4est_vtk.{c,h}</code>
with routines that write files to disk in the VTK graphics format.
The easiest call is
</p>
<pre class="book">
p4est_vtk_write_file (p4est, NULL, "filename");
</pre>
<p class="cont">
We take a valid <tt>p4est</tt> object, query its communicator for metadata,
and write the local quadrants using a filename that is postfixed with
<code>_rank.vtu</code>, where the rank is zero-padded to four digits.
For each quadrant, we write its MPI rank, tree number and level.
While the call is not strictly MPI-collective, the output is only complete
if every process calls it with the same filename.
Rank zero in addition writes a meta file ending in <code>.pvtu</code>
that contains a directory of all <code>.vtu</code> files written.
You may now use a visualization program to read these files and display them.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise: to visualize a connectivity structure, create a minimal <tt>p4est</tt>
at level zero and visualize that.
Experiment with varying MPI sizes and play with the <code>wrap_rank</code>
parameter.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise: Add some calls to <code>p4est_vtk_write_file</code>
to your favorite example program, using a different file name on each occasion,
and examine the results.
Visualize the tree number, MPI rank, and quadrant level.
</p>
<p class="book">
A more powerful interface to writing VTK files works as follows:
Create an opaque <tt>p4est</tt> VTK context, set parameters to the context,
write the file header, zero or more data arrays, and the file footer.
Writing the footer automatically deallocates the context and closes all files.
Please see the inline documentation in the header file for the prototypes.
</p>
<p class="book">
This interface allows to add custom data to the output.
The data may be provided per corner or per cell (quadrant).
Writing per corner requires a consistent corner numbering,
which will be discussed in a later tutorial.
The number of local quadrants is available from the <tt>p4est</tt> object,
and the input data array must match in length.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise: Create an <code>sc_array</code> (see the files
<code>sc/sc_containers.{c,h}</code> for details) of correct length.
Populate some per-quadrant data: Write a loop over the process-local trees,
inside over the tree-local quadrants, access each quadrant and invent the
data written for it as some function of its coordinates, level,
tree or sequence number or anything else.
Look at it to make sure everything is right.
Don't forget to deallocate the array after writing.
