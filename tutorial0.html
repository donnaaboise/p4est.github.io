We are organizing a <tt>p4est</tt> summer school
sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.
Please see also the school's <a

<h2>Building the Library</h2>
<p class="book">
We distribute <tt>p4est</tt> as source code.
The usual way to work with it is to download it in one of severaly
possible ways and to compile it.
This generates a binary software library and some ready-to-run examples that
come with it.
In this tutorial, we talk about the most common ways to build the software
and to write your own hello-world example program.
</p>
<p class="book">
You may find the <a href="https://p4est.github.io/release/p4est-2.2.tar.gz">
latest tarball</a> online, unpack it, then run configure and make.
If you specify an installation prefix to configure and run make install,
you will find the libraries and example programs in their proper directory.
From here on, you may include the header files in your own source code and link
your program to the library.
This method is probably the quickest to get going, but unsuited if you want
to make modifications to the <tt>p4est</tt> code and contribute to the source.
You get a frozen and stable but relatively old version of the code.
</p>
<p class="book">
A more active way of getting involved is to clone the
<a href="https://www.github.com/cburstedde/p4est.git">p4est github
repository</a>.
This requires to know how to use the revision control tool
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> or one of its many gui frontends.
We recommend to use the branch
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est/tree/prev3-develop">prev3-develop</a>,
which has minimized dependencies and contains the most modern set of
algorithms.
Using the source code on github enables you to contribute to the software
in the future and to receive latest updates by calling git pull.
Note that the tarballs generated by github do not work.
We do not include the configure script on github.
To generate it, call the
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est/blob/prev3-develop/bootstrap">./bootstrap</a>
script in the p4est toplevel source directory.
This requires a working installation of GNU
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/">autoconf</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/">automake</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/">libtool</a>.
