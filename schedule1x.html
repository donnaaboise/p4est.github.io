We are organizing a <tt>p4est</tt> summer school
sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.
Please see also the school's <a

We would like to begin by welcoming y'all to our online event.
The organizers CB, LW and ToI have written nearly all of the <tt>p4est</tt>
code, which came to life on Friday, November 23rd, 2007.
We think it is due time to share our perspectives on the code, inside
information on algorithms and concepts, and guidance on its use and extension
with our growing user base.
</p>
<p class="book">
DC and TiH have contributed a lot to other software libraries that rely on
<tt>p4est</tt> for scalable adaptivity, namely ForestClaw and deal.II.
They will share knowledge on their respective favorite codes and how these
interface to <tt>p4est</tt> and exploit the potential of dynamic adaptive mesh
refinement.
</p>
<p class="book">
This session is meant as a brief meet and greet and to give an overview of our
schedule and the nature of our tutorials.

<h2>Notes to self and loose ends</h2>
<p class="book">
How does this whole thing work!
</p>
<p class="book">
C code: there is no separate boolean datatype.  We use int,
as recommended by the standard, with 0 meaning false and everything else
meaning true.
Thus, the only safe way of testing for truth is <code>if (var)</code>
(or, if you insist, <code>if (var != 0)</code>).
You may technically use <code>if (var == 0)</code> to test for falseness
but we recommend <code>if (!var)</code>.
The <code>NULL</code> pointer always evaluates to false, but we try to
use the explicit test <code>if (pointer == NULL)</code> throughout.
</p>
<p class="book">
Terminology: element vs. quadrant.
Clarify that only leaves are stored.
</p>
<p class="book">
Use the source: inline doxygen comments, example programs.
Grep is your friend.
When writing code, use GNU indent via the <code>p4estindent</code> script,
disabling it by inline comments only in rare and obnoxious cases.
</p>
<p class="book">
What is a quadrant?  Refer to video lectures.
</p>
<p class="book">
The very basics of working with the code: <code>p4est</code> and
<code>p4est_connectivity</code> objects, loops over local trees and quadrants.
</p>
<p class="book">
Discuss partitioning and partition-independent checksum.
</p>
<p class="book">
If you find missing or incorrect documentation, specifically concerning the
inline doxygen-style comments, please correct them and write pull requests to
the <code>develop</code> branch.
