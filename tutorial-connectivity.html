We are organizing a <tt>p4est</tt> summer school
sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.
Please see also the school's <a

<h2>The roots of the forest</h2>
<p class="book">
The mesh topology of <tt>p4est</tt> is a general forest of octrees.
Each octree is a logical hypercube.
To represent a non-cubic domain \(\Omega\),
we begin by covering it with a conforming mesh of (potentially mapped)
squares (2D) or cubes (3D).
This coarsest possible mesh or <emph>connectivity</emph> cannot be changed
during the simulation.
In particular, it cannot be coarsened further.
It is thus wise to design it carefully.
A few guidelines are:
</p>
<ol class="book">
<li>Use as many cubes as needed to capture the domain's topology (connected
components, holes, tunnels, etc.).</li>
<li>Invest some more cubes to achieve an ideally uniform individual aspect
ratio of each cube.</li>
<li>Invest some more cubes if the distortion in any single mapped octree
appears too large.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of octrees if for some reason the coarse mesh must be
limited.</li>
</ol>
<p class="book">
We have successfully connected millions of octrees.  Below 100k, there is no
need to even think about reducing their number if the procedure would not be
obvious.
The connectivity is the first data structure that is built in a
<tt>p4est</tt> program.
This tutorial covers its definition and ways to construct it.

Construct several connectivities by builtin constructor functions.
Construct a connectivity by hard-coding its members yourself.
Use them one after the other to construct a <tt>p4est</tt> and visualize it via
the <a href="tutorial-io.html">VTK output</a>.

<h3>The <tt>p4est_connectivity</tt> data structure</h3>
<p class="book">
The convention for the connectivity's members is documented separately for the
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est/blob/prev3-develop/src/p4est_connectivity.h#L114-L144">2D connectivity</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est/blob/prev3-develop/src/p8est_connectivity.h#L117-L165">3D connectivity</a>.
Note that we prefix 2D functions and objects with <code>p4est</code> and their
3D cousins with <code>p8est</code>.
In principle, there is nothing wrong with allocating and populating it yourself.
This is, in fact, a great way to learn the meaning of its members.
However, there are other ways, too.
The easiest is to look through the
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est/blob/prev3-develop/src/p8est_connectivity.h">connectivity header</a> and call one of our provided
<code>p4est_connectivity_new_*</code> functions.
</p>
<p class="book">
You may  build any numbers of forests with one connectivity, but
please (a) destroy it only after the last of the forests has been freed and (b)
destroy it definitely.
It is advised to use the <code>valgrind</code> tool to check for proper deallocation.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise:
On one MPI rank, call <code>p4est_connectivity_save</code>,
<code>p4est_connectivity_load</code> and
<code>p4est_connectivity_is_equal</code> to verify that
the connectivity structure survived the file I/O.
Examine its contents with <code>gdb</code> and compare with the documentation
block in the header file.
Further down in the program, collectively call
<code>p4est_connectivity_bcast</code> to replicate the connectivity on all MPI
ranks of the world communicator.
Destroy the connectivities on all ranks.
Use <code>valgrind</code> to make sure no memory is leaked.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise:
Write a converter to load your favorite conforming hexahedral mesh format from
disk and populate a <tt>p4est</tt> connectivity structure in memory.
Use <code>p4est_connectivity_new</code> to allocate the required memory
once the numbers of trees and corner connections have been determined,
then hand-code a bunch of loops to fill all data fields with values.
Finally, check the object with <code>p4est_connectivity_is_valid</code>.
