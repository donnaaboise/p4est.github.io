<h2><tt>p4est</tt>: Parallel AMR on Forests of Octrees</h2>

<p>
The <tt>p4est</tt> software library enables the dynamic management of
a collection of adaptive octrees, conveniently called a forest of
octrees.  <tt>p4est</tt> is designed to work in parallel and scale to
hundreds of thousands of processor cores.  It is free software released
under GNU General Public Licence version 2.1, or (at your option) any
later version.

<h3>Technical papers</h3>
<p class="text">
The original technical paper on <tt>p4est</tt> is
<a href="http://p4est.github.io/papers/BursteddeWilcoxGhattas11.pdf">paper1 available as pdf</a> [1a].
We have recently submitted a second technical paper to cover additional
API functions;
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0089">see here for paper2</a> [1b].
Recently, the 2:1 balance algorithm has been rewritten; see
<a href="http://p4est.github.io/papers/IsaacBursteddeGhattas12.pdf"
>this article</a> [1c] on the new logic.

<tt>p4est</tt> is under active development and currently at version 1.0.
A previous version that is known to work with deal.II is
<a href="http://p4est.github.io/release/p4est-0.3.4.2.tar.gz"
>0.3.4.2</a>.

<p>
<tt>p4est</tt> uses <tt>libsc</tt> written by the same authors and others
for basic helper functionality such as logging, array and
hash data structures, parallel statistics, and more.  <tt>libsc</tt>
also integrates the third-party libraries <tt>zlib</tt> and
<tt>lua</tt>.  <tt>libsc</tt> is
free software under LGPL v2.1 (or later) and hosted under
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/libsc">github</a> as well.
